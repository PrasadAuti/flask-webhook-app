## üì° Usage
1. Open the dashboard in your browser.
    > The app will generate a unique user_id and assign it via cookies.

2. You‚Äôll see your personal webhook endpoint like:
    > /api/webhook/<user_id>

3. Send any HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to that endpoint. 
    > Example:
```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/webhook/<user_id> \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"hello":"world"}'

```
4. Refresh the dashboard ‚Üí new webhook appears in the list.
5. Click a webhook ‚Üí see details (headers, query params, payload).
6. Hover over a webhook ‚Üí red delete button (√ó) appears, click to remove it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- This uses SQLite (fine for dev/small projects). For production, use Postgres/MySQL.
- No authentication ‚Üí don‚Äôt expose to the public internet without securing.
- Payloads are stored as raw text. Large binary payloads may not render well in the UI.
